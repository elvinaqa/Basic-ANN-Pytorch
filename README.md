Basic ANN Pytorch Application with Python

# Model build
Code includes application of 2 different approaches for Pytorch ANNs during the build.
First is about the usual way of building the model which is also shown in Tensorflow codes and applications where model is build on a lined layers with .add function
While in the second approach, OOP is used for building the model by inheritance where basically, 2 functions makes the model: __init__ initiation and forward function ,namely.


# train_test_split
Secondly, difference is about # train_test_split where first way is conventional way of building model with sklearn.train_test_split
Then, latter way is about the usage of TensorDataset, Dataloader libs for splitting the data
